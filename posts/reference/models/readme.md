## Classification

 * Logistic Regression
 * Support Vector Machine
 * Neural Networks
 * Decision Trees
 * Random Forest
 * K Nearest Neighbours

## Regression

 * Linear Regression
 * K Nearest Neighbours
 * Generalize additive model

## Clustering

A typical and well-known type of unsupervised learning. Clustering algorithms try to find natural groupings in data. Similar data points (according to some notion of similarity) are considered in the same group. We call these groups clusters.

 * **K-Means clustering** is a simple and widely-used clustering algorithm. Given value of k , it tries to build k clusters from samples in the dataset.
 
## Dimension reduction
