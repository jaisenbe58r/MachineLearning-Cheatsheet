## Supervised learning

It is **function approximation**. So it's about figuring out the common rule (a function) that applies to **labeled data**, in order to predict new unlabeled data in the future.

> #### Steps:
> 1. Collect labeled data
> 2. Inferring a function.
> 3. Predict new data!

## Unsupervised learning

It is **description**. So it's about looking at **unlabeled data** and detect its structure just by observing the data samples and the realtion between them.

## Reinforcement learning

It can be seen as an hybrid of supervised learning and unsupervised learning in terms that in supervised learning you get an inmedate feedback (the labeled data) and in unsupervised learning you never get a feedback (unlabeled data). But in reinforcement learning, the feedback is obtained progressively in time, as long as you commit certains actions.
